Content Republish allows you to easily clone your posts, update the content and schedule it for republication.

== Description ==

**An easy way to clone your post, update the content, and republish it without any disruption to the original post.**

Content Republish is the best tool for content publisher. With a single click, you can clone your existing posts, make changes and republish them. It is like a staging area for your draft content, where you can make any changes without affecting the original post. When you are satisfied with the changes, you republish it and the draft content will overwrite the existing content.

## No disruption to your workflow ##

The cloned post retains the same permission as the original post. You can update or edit the content just like normal post.

## User permission ##

Decide which user role is allowed to clone post. For a multi-user site, the administrator can grant the cloning permission to the Editor and then assign it to the Contributor to update the content.

## Supports Gutenberg/Block editor ##

Content Republish works on both the Gutenberg/Block Editor and Classic editor.

## It clones the complete post, not just the content ##

Content Republish doesn't just copy the content, it clones the whole post, including its taxonomies, author, date, custom fields. This means that any plugins that use the taxonomies and custom fields (like Advanced Custom Fields) will continue to work in Content Republish. You can update the category, tags and custom fields too, and they will replace the original content during republication.

## Schedule Future Updates to Posts ##

Do you want your update to go live at a certain time? No problem! Content Republish allows you to schedule your cloned post, and it will republish at the time of your choice.

## Revisions ##

A new revision is created when the post is republished. If you don't like the changes, you can visit the Revisions section to view and restore the original content.

## Convert any post to republish post ##

On a draft post that you are already working on, you can convert it into a republish post.
